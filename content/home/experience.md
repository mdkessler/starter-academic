  - title: Associate Manager, Statistical Genetics
    company: Regeneron Genetics Center LLC, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
    company_url: 'https://www.regeneron.com/science/genetics-center'
    location: New York
    date_start: '2021-2-22'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        * Led germline cancer genetic association analysis across >100 EHR derived cancer phenotypes, which led to >3 patent filings within my first 18 months
        * Discovered >20 novel germline genetic loci associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), including multiple independent protective missense variant associations supportive of therapeutic target potential
        * Presentated scientific results to senior R&D leadership, including company co-founder and CSO
        * Performed large-scale genetic analysis using cloud-based computational infrastructure (e.g. AWS, DNANexus), and developed >5 DNANexus applets as components of genetic data processing pipelines
        * Applied numerous statistical and translation genetic techniques (e.g. GWAS, fine-mapping, regression and classification, meta analysis, genetic risk scores) for the analysis of genetic and phenotypic data
        * Worked and collaborated across pharmacogenomic, therapeutic area, clinical trial, and translational genetic teams as part of multiple interdisciplinary cancer projects
        * Started and led a "Code Sharing" initiative across all Regeneron Genetic Center analytical teams in order to increase computational learning, visibility, resource usage, and efficiency <!--I was invited to present on this effort to the Regenerone-wide data science community that encompasses hundreds of data scienctists across the entire company.--!>
  - title: Postdoctoral Research Fellow
    company: The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
    company_url: 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org'
    location: Maryland
    date_start: '2019-12-02'
    date_end: '2021-02-21'
    description: |2-
        * Identified associations between latent patterns of immune checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma and progression free survival
        * Worked on the integration of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing data
        * Developed and implemented a novel machine learning algorithm that uses a top-scoring pairs (TSP) approach to perform regression
        * Characterized the super enhancer landscape and associated transcription factor enrichements in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
        * Identified gene candidates underpinning the association between vitamin D and head and neck cancer
        * Worked on the implemention of a method to estimate per sample immunogenicity scores that derive from cancer-specific alternative splicing events
      <!--   
      Responsibilities included:
        
        * Presenting at team meeting
        * Writing manuscripts and grants
        * Mentoring undergraduate and graduate students
        * Interviewing job candidates

  - title: Graduate Research Assistant
    company: Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore
    company_url: 'https://www.igs.umaryland.edu'
    location: Maryland
    date_start: '2015-05-15'
    date_end: '2019-11-30'
    description: |2-
      * Characterized and analyzed genetic variant distributions from > 40,000 human genomes as part of the NHLBI TOPMed program
      * Analyzed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from > 1000 Samoan individuals to study the evolutionary history of modern Samoa
      * Calculated and analyzed de novo mutation rates across ancestrally diverse human populations and discovered a mutation reduction in the Amish founder population
      * Determined the genetic ancestry for 1018 common cancer cell line models and identified gene expression and mutation differences from ancestrally diverse cancer cell lines
      * Researched and wrote a review of cutting-edge approaches for cancer detection and treatment via non-invasive liquid biopsy
      * Demonstrated that significant cost and time biases exist when performing clinical genetic variant prioritization on individuals with non-European ancestral backgrounds
