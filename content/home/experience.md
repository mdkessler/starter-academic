        * Identified associatiosn between latent patterns of immune checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma and progression free survival
        * Participated in projects working to integrate single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing data
        * Used feature selection to identify candidate genes from high-dimensional transcriptomic data 
        * Developed and implemented a novel machine learning algorithm that uses a top-scoring pairs (TSP) approach to perform regression
        * Characterized the super enhancer landscape and associated transcription factor enrichements in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
        * Identified gene candidates underpinning the association between vitamin D and head and neck cancer
        * Led a project developing and implementing a method to estimate per sample immunogenicity scores that derive from cancer-specific alternative splicing events
        
        Responsibilities included:
        
        * Presenting at team meeting
        * Writing manuscripts and grants
        * Mentoring undergraduate and graduate students
        * Interviewing job candidates

      * Characterized and analyzed genetic variant distributions from > 40,000 human genomes as part of the NHLBI TOPMed program
      * Analyzed whole genome sequencing data from $>$ 1000 Samoan individuals to study the evolutionary history of modern Samoa
      * Calculated and analyzed de novo mutation rates across ancestrally diverse human populations and discovered a mutation reduction in the Amish founder population
      * Determined the genetic ancestry for 1018 common cancer cell line models and identified gene expression and mutation differences from ancestrally diverse cancer cell lines
      * Researched and wrote a review of cutting-edge approaches for cancer detection and treatment via non-invasive liquid biopsy
      * Demonstrated that significant cost and time biases when performing clinical genetic variant prioritization on individuals with non-European ancestral backgrounds
