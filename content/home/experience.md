        Worked on:
        
        * Latent patterns of immune checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma that associate with progression free survival, the immunogenialternative splicing , super enhancers
        * The integration of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing data
        * Feature selection in high-dimensional transcriptomic data 
        * Top-scoring pairs (TSP) algorithms for classification and regression
        * The super enhancer landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
        * Gene candidates underpinning the association between vitamin D and head and neck cancer
        * The estimation of a per sample immunogenicity score that derives from cancer-specific alternative splicing events
        
        Responsibilities included:
        
        * Presenting at team meeting
        * Writing manuscripts and grants
        * Mentoring undergraduate and graduate students
        * Interviewing job candidates
        
  - title: Graduate Research Assistant
    company: Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore
    company_url: 'https://www.igs.umaryland.edu'
    location: Maryland
    date_start: '2015-05-15'
    date_end: '2019-11-30'
    description: |2-
    * Characterized and analyzed genetic variant distributions from > 40,000 human genomes as part of the NHLBI TOPMed program
    * Analyzed whole genome sequencing data from $>$ 1000 Samoan individuals to study the evolutionary history of modern Samoa
    * Calculated and analyzed de novo mutation rates across ancestrally diverse human populations and discovered a mutation reduction in the Amish founder population
    * Determined the genetic ancestry for 1018 common cancer cell line models and identified gene expression and mutation differences from ancestrally diverse cancer cell lines
    * Researched and wrote a review of cutting-edge approaches for cancer detection and treatment via non-invasive liquid biopsy
    * Demonstrated that significant cost and time biases when performing clinical genetic variant prioritization on individuals with non-European ancestral backgrounds
