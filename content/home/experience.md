        * Led germline cancer genetic association analysis across >100 EHR derived cancer phenotypes, which led to >3 patent filings within 15 months
        * Discovered >20 novel germline genetic loci associated with clonal hematopoiesis phenotypes, including signals with therapeutic target potential
        * Presentated scientific results to senior R&D leadership, including company co-founder and CSO
        * Performed large-scale genetic analysis using cloud-based computational infrastructure (e.g. AWS, DNANexus)
        * Developed >5 DNANexus applets as components of genetic data processing pipelines
        * Applied numerous statistical and translation genetic techniques (e.g. GWAS, fine-mapping, ML) for the analysis of genetic and phenotypic data
        * Collaborated across pharmacogenomic, therapeutic, clinical, and translational teams as part of multiple interdisciplinary cancer projects
        * Started and led a code sharing initiative across analytical teams to increase computational learning, visibility, resource usage, and efficiency

      * Characterized and analyzed genetic variant distributions from > 40,000 human genomes as part of the NHLBI TOPMed program
      * Analyzed whole genome sequencing data from >1000 Samoan individuals to study the evolutionary history of modern Samoa
      * Calculated and analyzed de novo mutation rates across ancestrally diverse human populations and discovered a mutation reduction in the Amish founder population
      * Determined the genetic ancestry for 1018 common cancer cell line models and identified gene expression and mutation differences from ancestrally diverse cancer cell lines
      * Researched and wrote a review of cutting-edge approaches for cancer detection and treatment via non-invasive liquid biopsy
      * Demonstrated that significant cost and time biases exist when performing clinical genetic variant prioritization on individuals with non-European ancestral backgrounds
