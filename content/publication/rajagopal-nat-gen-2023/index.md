abstract: 'Human genetic studies of smoking behavior have been thus far largely limited to common variants. Studying rare coding variants has the potential to identify drug targets. We performed an exome-wide association study of smoking phenotypes in up to 749,459 individuals and discovered a protective association in CHRNB2, encoding the β2 subunit of the α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor. Rare predicted loss-of-function and likely deleterious missense variants in CHRNB2 in aggregate were associated with a 35% decreased odds for smoking heavily (odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, confidence interval (CI) = 0.56–0.76, P = 1.9 × 10−8). An independent common variant association in the protective direction (rs2072659; OR = 0.96; CI = 0.94–0.98; P = 5.3 × 10−6) was also evident, suggesting an allelic series. Our findings in humans align with decades-old experimental observations in mice that β2 loss abolishes nicotine-mediated neuronal responses and attenuates nicotine self-administration. Our genetic discovery will inspire future drug designs targeting CHRNB2 in the brain for the treatment of nicotine addiction.'
